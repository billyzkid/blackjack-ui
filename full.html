            <h2>Rules of Blackjack</h2>
            <p>Players are each dealt two cards face up. The dealer is also dealt two cards, one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are all worth 10. Aces can be worth 1 or 11. A hand's value is the sum of its card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called "soft", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become 1 to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is called "hard".</p>
            <p>Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer's hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the hand is 17 or higher. Players are betting that they have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the one closest to 21 without exceeding 21. The outcome of the hand follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the player has an ace and a 10-value card (called a "blackjack" or "natural") and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.</li>
                <li>If the player exceeds 21 ("busts"), the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.</li>
                <li>If the dealer exceeds 21 ("busts") and the player does not, the player wins.</li>
                <li>If the player does not bust and the player's hand exceeds the dealer's hand, the player wins.</li>
                <li>If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same value (called a "push"), no one wins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight standard 52-card decks are shuffled together. At the beginning of each round, the players place their bets in the "betting box" at each position in play.</p>
            <p>The dealer deals cards from their left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as "first base") to their far right ("third base"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to all the players at the table. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in "hole card" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack.</p>
            <p>The object of the game from the player's perspective is to win money by creating card totals that are higher than those of the dealer's hand, but do not exceed 21 ("busting"), or alternatively, by "standing" (not taking a card) at any total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players must choose whether to "hit" (take a card), "stand" (end their turn), "double" (double wager, take a single card and finish), "split" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or "surrender" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all players have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher. The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a "natural" or "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as "push" or "standoff", bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Most games provide a side bet called "insurance", which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace.</p>
            <h2>Player decisions</h2>
            <p>After receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: "hit", "stand", "double down", or "split". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, "surrender".</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Hit</u>: Take another card from the dealer.</li>
                <li><u>Stand</u>: Take no more cards, also known as "stand pat", "stick", or "stay".</li>
                <li><u>Double down</u>: The player is allowed to increase the initial bet up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card.</li>
                <li><u>Split</u>: If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. An ace and 10-value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed.</li>
                <li><u>Surrender</u>: Some games offer the option to "surrender" as the first decision of the hand directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each hand may hit as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the player's wager is immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in counterclockwise order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.</p>
            <h2>Insurance</h2>
            <p>If the dealer's up card is an ace, you are allowed to make an "insurance" bet. This is a side bet that the dealer has a 10-value card as the down card, giving the dealer a blackjack. The dealer will ask for insurance bets from all players before the first player plays. You make this bet by placing chips equal to a maximum of half of your current bet. If the dealer has a 10, the insurance bet pays 2:1. In most casinos, the dealer then peeks at the down card and pays or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.</p>
            <p>Players with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they will win an amount equal to their main wager. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as "taking even money". There is no difference in results between taking even money and insuring a blackjack.</p>
